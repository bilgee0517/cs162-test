## hey, helen here! 

I am in my senior year of undergrad at the _world's most innovative university_ - Minerva. Yes, I have been traveling through 7 countries (4 continents) while earning a double degree in Business & CS, adapting to new cultures (both country- and company-related), and learning how to pack my life in a 50-pound suitcase, aka embracing a scrappy and minimalistic mindset. Originally a Ukrainian, now a global citizen, I've lived through it all - COVID, war, poverty, and other world chaos in the most minor parts of our planet. 

I've embraced my entrepreneurial spirit from the heart of Silicon Valley, where I spent my first year and got a product internship with my first startup. Since then, I've worked with seven startups worldwide, __managing products from 0 to 1__ and __overseeing growth__. Now, I am a product and growth lead at Farloe, a startup in the realm of sustainable personal styling = women empowerment. 

>"think big, start small, learn fast" - my motto to keep ideas becoming reality ðŸ’«

p.s. I love music (11y. of classic piano! + collecting vinyls), hiking (Glacier Martial in Ushuaia!), and unique coffee bars.
