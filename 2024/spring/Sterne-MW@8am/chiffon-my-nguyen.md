# About Me

I go by Chiffon at Minerva, but my legal is My (pronounced *me*). I know human identities are socially constructed, but I really like label myself, as:
- a lifelong learner
- an avid reader
- a minimalist
- a plant-based eater
- a LGBTQIA+ ally and advocate
- a personal knowledge management enthusiast (frequent Obsidian user)
- a (potential) polyglot

Some of the ideas I push for are: diversity and inclusion, equality and equity, accessibility, and sustainability. I also like to write and think more recently.

# What I'm Doing Now
- Finishing my [RAG-based system for personal knowledge management](https://github.com/chiffonng/knowledge-rag)
- Learning Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing in depth
- Learning Flask and React
- Learning how to write better
- Reading more diverse and difficult books: The God of Small Things and If I had Your Face
