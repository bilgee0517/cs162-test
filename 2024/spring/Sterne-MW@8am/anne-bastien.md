# Hey!

I'm **Anne** from Montreal, Canada. My classmates call me *Granne* because I'm one of the oldest students in my cohort.
My interests constantly change. Recently, I'm interested in:

- Automation / Custom tech -- I met someone who tries to automate a lot of his life or simplify tasks using code. For instance, he connected his Alexa to Telegram so that he could text Alexa instead of talking out loud to Alexa.
- Indigenous technology -- During my remote semester one of my assignments was to learn more about the value of indigenous technology and how it can help tackle climate change, waste processing and more.
- Innovating education -- Need I say more?
